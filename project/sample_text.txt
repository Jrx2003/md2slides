This project, markdown to slides, is just as its name suggestsâ€”a convenient tool that lets you generate slides using simple markdown. If you ever receive an urgent task that requires you to prepare a presentation in five minutes, you should give this a try. If you're tired of having GPT generate slide content and then painstakingly copying and formatting it in PowerPoint, you should try this. And if you want clean, themed slides without having to learn the complex syntax of reveal.js or LaTeX Beamer, then this is definitely for you. Now, it's demo time.
